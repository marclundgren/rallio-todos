# rallio-todos

Use this doc for the app spec requirements. Begin by understanding the [Template section of the Functionality Requirements](https://github.com/marclundgren/rallio-todos#template).

If you have any questions about the requirements, this document, or running the ember application on your computer locally, let us know as soon as you can.

## Functionality Requirements

### Template

[Ember.js](https://emberjs.com/) uses a templating system called `htmlbars`, which is modeled after [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/). Check out their documentation for reference only, ignoring the javascript portion of handlebars.

Handlebars and htmlbars are templating systems that produce raw html markup. In this challenge, we can provide the end result desired [html markup](https://github.com/rallio/rallio-todos/blob/master/index-static.html). Your goal is to write use ember.js to write the dynamic templates and javascript controllers to "wire up" the UI.

You'll note a few things in the template:
* There is no styling, this you can add
* There is a header
* There is a main section
* There is a footer
* Inside the main section, a list `ul` of todos `li` live
* Each `li` todo has a conditional `completed` class name
* Each `li` todo has a todo label (e.g. Buy a unicorn)
* Each `li` todo has a "destroy" button
* The header has an input for adding a new todo
* (optional) the footer has 3 selectable filters: "All", "Active", "Completed"
* (optional) the footer has a "clear all completed" button

### (required) No todos

When there are no todos, the list of todos `<main></main>` and (optional) filters `<footer></footer>` should not be displayed. IOW, only display these elements when there is at least one todo.

### (required) New todo

New todos are entered in the input at the top of the app. (optional) The input element should be focused when the page is loaded, preferably by using the autofocus input attribute. (optional) Pressing Enter creates the todo, appends it to the todo list, and clears the input. (optional) Make sure to `.trim()` the input and then check that it's not empty before creating a new todo.

### (required) Marking one todo as completed


### (optional) Mark all as complete

This checkbox toggles all the todos to the same state as itself. Make sure to clear the checked state after the "Clear completed" button is clicked. The "Mark all as complete" checkbox should also be updated when single todo items are checked/unchecked. Eg. When all the todos are checked it should also get checked.
Item

A todo item has three possible interactions:

1. Clicking the checkbox marks the todo as complete by updating its completed value and toggling the class completed on its parent `<li>`

2. Double-clicking the `<label>` activates editing mode, by toggling the .editing class on its `<li>`

3. Hovering over the todo shows the remove button (`.destroy`)

### (optional) Editing

When editing mode is activated it will hide the other controls and bring forward an input that contains the todo title, which should be focused (`.focus()`). The edit should be saved on both blur and enter, and the editing class should be removed. Make sure to `.trim()` the input and then check that it's not empty. If it's empty the todo should instead be destroyed. If escape is pressed during the edit, the edit state should be left and any changes be discarded.
### (optional) Counter

Displays the number of active todos in a pluralized form. Make sure the number is wrapped by a `<strong>` tag. Also make sure to pluralize the item word correctly: 0 items, 1 item, 2 items. Example: 2 items left

### (optional) Clear completed button

Removes completed todos when clicked. Should be hidden when there are no completed todos.

### (optional) All, Active, Completed Filters

"All" should be active by default and will display all todos, regardless of their "completed" status. Selecting the "Active" filter will display only todo items that have `completed === false`. Selectin the "Completed" filter will display only todo items that have `completed === true`.

### (required) UI layout

Structure the UI to look something like the following example. Structure and layout are much more important than the "look-and-feel" or "skin". Focus on getting elements to align properly first before making it look ðŸ’„. Consider todos with a very long body, be careful these types of todos maintain the integrity of the structure.

## Ember.js Concepts
Routes
    In Ember, the state of an application is represented by a URL. Each URL has a corresponding route object that controls what is visible to the user.

Models
    Every route has an associated model, containing the data associated with the current state of the application.[20] While one can use jQuery to load JSON objects from a server and use those objects as models, most applications use a model library such as Ember Data to handle this.

Templates
    Templates are used to build the application's HTML and are written with the HTMLBars templating language. (HTMLBars is a variation of Handlebars that builds DOM elements rather than a String.)[21]

Components
    A component is a custom HTML tag. Behavior is implemented using JavaScript and its appearance is defined using HTMLBars templates. Components "own" their data. They can also be nested and can communicate with their parent components through actions (events). Other component libraries such as Polymer can also be used with Ember.

## Ember.js Prerequisites

You will need the following things properly installed on your computer.

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (with npm)
* [Ember CLI](https://ember-cli.com/)
* [Google Chrome](https://google.com/chrome/)

## Installation

* `git clone marclundgren/rallio-todos` this repository
* `cd rallio-todos`
* `npm install`

## Running / Development

* `ember serve`
* Visit your app at [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200).
* Visit your tests at [http://localhost:4200/tests](http://localhost:4200/tests).

### Code Generators

Make use of the many generators for code, try `ember help generate` for more details
